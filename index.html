                        <p>Being a tech-based college, it's important to us that our students are more than well
                            equipped and ready to tackle the problems of the modern day. We're consistently keeping 
                            up-to-date with emerging technologies and new software developments in order to 
                            provide the best learning platform we can, and to ensure our students learn from the technology
                            relevant for their future careers.

                            The students have access to a range of pre-paid learning libraries online, one of them being LinkedIn Learning.
                            The college has partnered with LinkedIn Learning to give the students an industry-standard source to learn 
                            more about the topics they are studying, or to develop their own skills in their own time. We believe that 
                            a student should be given these useful resources to have the opportunity to broaden their skill set if wanted.
